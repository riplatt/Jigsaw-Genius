- **Automatic Persistence**: All progress is automatically saved to browser storage

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### Solving Strategy

The solver uses a **non-backtracking statistical approach** with the following key components:

1. **Fixed Placement Order**: Follows a predetermined sequence starting with hint-adjacent positions
2. **Edge Validation**: Ensures pieces fit by matching edge colors and border constraints
3. **Machine Learning Weighting**: Uses exponential weighting based on historical performance

### Machine Learning Implementation

```javascript
// Weight calculation for piece selection
weight = exp(k * (localAvgScore - globalAvgScore))
```

- **Calibration Phase**: First 1000 runs establish baseline performance
- **Adaptive Selection**: Pieces with better historical performance get higher selection probability
- **Continuous Learning**: Statistics update after each solving attempt

### Puzzle Constraints

- **Board Size**: 16×16 (256 total pieces)
- **Fixed Hints**: 5 pre-placed pieces at specific positions
- **Edge Colors**: 23 different edge colors (0-22, where 0 = border)
- **Rotations**: Each piece can be rotated in 90° increments

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Regular Exports**: Save your progress frequently using CSV export
2. **Browser Resources**: Close other tabs for better performance during long runs
3. **Learning Rate**: Start with lower values (0.1-0.3) for more stable learning
4. **Calibration**: Allow the full 1000-run calibration for optimal ML performance
